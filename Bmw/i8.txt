The BMW i8, first introduced as the BMW Concept Vision Efficient Dynamics, is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. 
The i8 is part of BMW's "Project i" and it is being marketed as a new brand, BMW i. 
The 2015 model year BMW i8 has a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). 
Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cycle, the range in EV mode is 24 km (15 mi) with a small amount of gasoline consumption. 
The design is heavily influenced by the BMW M1 Hommage Concept (which is itself, a retro concept of the original M1).
