The BMW X3 is a compact luxury crossover SUV manufactured by German automaker BMW since 2003. 
Based on the BMW 3 Series platform, and now in its second generation, BMW markets the crossover as a Sports Activity Vehicle, the company's proprietary descriptor for its X-line of vehicles. 
The first generation X3 was designed by BMW in conjunction with Magna Steyr of Graz, Austria—who also manufactured all X3s under contract to BMW. 
BMW manufactures the second generation X3 at their Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, United States.
